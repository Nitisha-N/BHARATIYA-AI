## AI for Bharat Hackathon – Student Track  
**Track:** AI for Learning & Developer Productivity

---

## 📌 Overview

The AI-Powered Learning Assistant is an educational support system designed to help students understand Machine Learning and Data Science concepts more effectively. It enables students to upload their own study materials (such as PDFs or datasets) and interact with them using natural language questions to receive simple explanations, insights, and guided learning support.

The project focuses on improving learning productivity, conceptual clarity, and real-world understanding rather than complex automation or enterprise-scale solutions.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Students learning Machine Learning and Data Science often struggle to understand complex concepts from static study materials such as lecture notes, PDFs, and datasets. Existing tools are either too generic, overly technical, or disconnected from the learner’s actual content, leading to slower learning and confusion.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

This project proposes an AI-powered learning assistant that transforms static study materials into an interactive learning experience. By allowing students to ask questions in natural language and receive context-aware explanations and dataset-driven insights, the system enhances learning efficiency and comprehension.

---

## 👤 Target Users

- Students learning Machine Learning and Data Science
- Beginners who need simplified explanations
- Learners working with real datasets and lecture materials

---

## ✨ Key Features

- Upload and process study materials (PDFs, CSV, Excel, JSON)
- Ask questions in natural language
- Receive student-friendly concept explanations
- Generate dataset summaries and insights
- Maintain learning session context
- Suggest next steps and related learning topics
- Provide clear guidance and error handling

---

## 🔁 Use Case Flow

1. Student opens the learning assistant  
2. Student uploads study material  
3. System processes and confirms the upload  
4. Student asks a question in natural language  
5. System provides explanations or dataset insights  
6. Student asks follow-up questions  
7. System maintains context and continues the session  
8. System suggests next learning steps  

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture (High-Level)

The system follows a layered architecture:

- **Presentation Layer:** Student Interface (UI)
- **Input Processing Layer:** File processing and query preprocessing
- **Intelligence Layer:** Language Model for understanding and explanation
- **Knowledge Layer:** Processed study material and dataset insights
- **Response Layer:** Structured response generation and guidance

Detailed architecture and design decisions are documented in `design.md`.
